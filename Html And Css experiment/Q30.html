    <div>Introduction to Linux Linux is an open-source Unix-like operating system-based family on the Linux kernel, and the OS kernel was first published on 17 September 1991 by Linus Torvalds. Typically, Linux is packaged as the Linux distribution, which contains the supporting libraries and system software and kernel, several of which are offered by the GNU Project. Several Linux distributions use the term "Linux" in the title, but the Free Software Foundation uses the "GNU/Linux" title to focus on the necessity of GNU software, causing a few controversies.</div>
